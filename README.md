# Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm Implementation

This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to find the constant term (secret) of a polynomial given its roots. The roots are provided in a JSON file, and the program decodes the values, performs Lagrange interpolation, and outputs the secret.
